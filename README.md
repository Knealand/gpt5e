# GPT-5e Flask API
 
This project implements a Flask-based API that leverages the LangChain library for conversational retrieval using GPT models. It's fined tuned to answer questions related to the rules of Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) by utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4 model and a FAISS vectorstore.

## Features
- D&D Rulebook Knowledge: Specialized in D&D rules, including the Playerâ€™s Handbook, Dungeon Master's Guide, and Monster Manual.
- OpenAI GPT-4 Integration: Utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4 model for generating responses.
- FAISS Vectorstore: Efficient document retrieval using FAISS.
- Secure Access: API requests are secured with API key authentication.

## Installation

## Usage

To use the API:

1. Send a POST request to /gtp5e/question with a valid x-api-key header.
2. Include a JSON body with the prompt field.

### Example:
```
POST /gtp5e
Headers: 
  Content-Type: application/json
  x-api-key: your_valid_api_key

Body:
